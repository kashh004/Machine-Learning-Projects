# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains various machine learning projects focused on different datasets and problem statements. Each project leverages different machine learning and AutoML techniques to optimize model performance. Below is an overview of the main projects included.

## Projects

### 1. Automated Model Optimization for Breast Cancer Diagnosis using TPOT

- **Project Directory**: `Automated Model Optimization for Breast Cancer Diagnosis using TPOT`
- **Notebook**: `Breast_Cancer_Diagnosis_AutoML.ipynb`
- **Description**: This project uses the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset** and applies the TPOT AutoML tool to optimize models for predicting whether a tumor is malignant or benign.
- **Key Techniques**: 
  - AutoML with TPOT
  - Model selection and hyperparameter tuning
- **Best Model Accuracy**: 95%

### 2. Verdict AI

- **Project Directory**: `Verdict_AI`
- **Notebook**: `IPC.ipynb`
- **Description**: This project aims to predict the most suitable Indian Penal Code (IPC) section based on an input offense description. The model also provides the associated legal description and punishment.
- **Key Techniques**: 
  - Text processing with TF-IDF vectorization
  - Multi-target classification
  - Logistic Regression for predicting multiple outputs
- **Best Model Accuracy**: Achieved through separate evaluation metrics for predicting IPC section, description, and punishment.
